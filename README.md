# Accident-Detection-and-Signal-Regulation-System
Accurate accident detection and efficient traffic control are crucial for improving road safety. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated remarkable potential in this domain. This repository focuses on utilizing deep learning models to detect accidents and control traffic, leveraging large-scale datasets for training and optimization.

# Overview
The primary objective is to automatically detect accidents using deep learning. 

The process involves the following steps:

1.Dataset Collection: A diverse dataset containing both accident and non-accident samples is collected. This dataset serves as the foundation for training deep learning models.

2.Model Training: Deep learning models are trained using the collected dataset. The models automatically learn features and patterns indicative of accidents, leading to accurate detection.

3.Optimization and Fine-Tuning: The trained models undergo extensive optimization and fine-tuning processes to ensure high accuracy in accident detection.

4.Alerts and Emergency Services: Upon detecting an accident, the system is designed to trigger alerts and notify emergency services, facilitating a prompt response.

# Vehicle Detection and Traffic Control 
In addition to accident detection, the system employs deep learning techniques for vehicle detection and analysis. Cameras and image processing algorithms are used to accurately identify and track vehicles. This information is then utilized to dynamically adjust signal timings at junctions, optimizing traffic flow.
